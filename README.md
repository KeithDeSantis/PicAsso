# PicAsso: ```Picture Assorting Assistant``` 

A side-project I've been working on that loosely organizea images by their dominant color.

I tried multiple methods to sort the images into color clusters, mainly trying to use some AI skills I'd learned, including:

* `Genetic Algorithms` (no longer included)
* `Hill Climbing with Random Restarts`
* `Expansive Sorting`

At the moment the code is configured to run Expansive Sorting as I was most please with those results. The original intention with the program was to create a collage of my favorite albums, but it can be used on any set of images.
